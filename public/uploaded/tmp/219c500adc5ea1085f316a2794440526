#Step3 - Netty with ekstazi

# For Rev1 2a5adc0b2bce398b821b491c2f8a49562ecb1567

git clone https://github.com/netty/netty/
cd netty 
git checkout 2a5adc0b2bce398b821b491c2f8a49562ecb1567
cd testsuite
make the necessary change in pom.xml for ekstazi plugin.
mvn test | tee nettyEKSStep1.txt

Once mvn test is run table with number of tests is calculated as below
 
 No of tests =
 grep "Tests run" nettyEKSStep1.txt  | awk 'BEGIN {sum=0}{sum=sum+$3}END{print sum}'

 Time taken =
grep "Tests run" nettyEKSStep1.txt  | awk 'BEGIN {sum=0}{sum=sum+$12}END{print sum}'

#######
After all the steps and tables are computed,
the final Step3.txt and Table3.txt is calculated manually by taking corresponding entries from Step and Table files from each of the above output (3 revisions)

I want to thank my project partner Shyam Rajendran (srajend2) for helping me with scripts for calculating number of tests and total duration for each of the revisions.
