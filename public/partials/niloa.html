            The <a href="http://www.learningoutcomeassessment.org/" target="_blank">National Institute for Learning
            Outcomes Assessment (NILOA)</a> has been working with groups of faculty from various institutions to revise
            and strengthen assignment alignment to specific proficiencies. The assignments and commentaries here are
            works in progress, generously shared by faculty members from a wide range of fields and institutional types
            committed to advancing and documenting student learning. To learn more about the assignment library

            <p><b>The Peer Review Process</b></p>

            <p class="justified">
                The materials in the DQP Assignment Library have gone through a three-stage review process. The first
                stage of review is undertaken by the NILOA project team, which makes decisions about whether to accept
                the submission or not.  Those selected for a second stage of review are then shared with three to six
                faculty peers, typically from the same or related fields, who have experience with assignment design;
                their role is to provide written feedback and suggestions for revision.  After making revisions, authors
                resubmit their materials to NILOA, where they pass through a final review to make sure that all required
                elements are included, and minor copy editing as needed.  The finished materials are then published to
                the site.
            </p>

            <p class="justified">
                We recognize, however, that assignment design is an iterative process, and we expect that many of the
                materials posted here will undergo further revision and improvement.  Authors are encouraged to submit
                updated versions of their materials and to continue reporting how the assignment is being used in their
                classrooms.
